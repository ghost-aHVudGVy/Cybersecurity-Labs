# Incident Response Lifecycle Simulation – Endpoint Security Incident

## Overview

This repository documents a simulated incident response engagement conducted against a suspected security incident on a Windows endpoint. The objective was to follow the full incident response lifecycle as defined by NIST SP 800-61, from detection through post-incident analysis, in a controlled lab environment.

This exercise mirrors how a junior security analyst would support incident response activities within a real SecOps team, with emphasis on structured investigation, containment, remediation, and clear documentation.

---

## Incident Scenario

A Windows endpoint exhibited indicators of suspicious activity consistent with potential malware execution or unauthorized access. Observed symptoms included abnormal PowerShell execution patterns and alerts generated by endpoint security controls.

The incident was treated as a medium-severity endpoint compromise pending further investigation.

---

## Tools and Environment

- Windows 10 / Windows Server (local lab environment)
- Windows Defender Antivirus
- Event Viewer
- PowerShell
- Task Manager
- Local administrative access

---

## Incident Response Methodology

The response followed the NIST SP 800-61 Incident Response Lifecycle:

1. Detection and Analysis  
2. Triage and Initial Investigation  
3. Containment  
4. Eradication and Recovery  
5. Post-Incident Analysis  

---

## Phase 1: Detection and Analysis

### Detection

The incident was initially detected through endpoint monitoring and observation of suspicious behavior, including encoded PowerShell execution, which is commonly associated with malware activity.

Windows Defender was reviewed to confirm security alerts and identify potential threats.

---

### Initial Analysis

Event logs were reviewed using Event Viewer to identify suspicious process creation and PowerShell execution events. Task Manager was used to inspect running processes for anomalies.

Key indicators identified:
- Encoded PowerShell command execution
- Execution under a standard user context
- No immediate signs of lateral movement

## Phase 2: Triage and Initial Investigation

### Incident Classification

Based on the findings, the incident was classified as a suspected malware infection affecting a single endpoint.

Severity was assessed as medium due to:
- Confirmed suspicious execution
- No evidence of privilege escalation
- No evidence of spread to other systems

---

### Scope Assessment

The investigation confirmed the incident was isolated to one endpoint. No additional systems or user accounts appeared to be affected.

---

## Phase 3: Containment

### Endpoint Isolation

To prevent potential spread or further damage, the affected endpoint was isolated by disabling network connectivity.

This mirrors endpoint isolation performed through EDR platforms in production environments.

---

### Evidence Preservation

Before remediation, relevant evidence was noted, including:
- Suspicious command execution
- Associated timestamps
- Defender alert details

This information was preserved to support post-incident analysis.

---

## Phase 4: Eradication and Recovery

### Eradication

Windows Defender was used to quarantine and remove the detected threat. Additional checks were performed to ensure no persistence mechanisms remained.

Actions taken:
- Malicious process terminated
- Threat quarantined
- Startup and scheduled task review performed

---

### Recovery

After confirming the threat was removed:
- Network connectivity was restored
- System updates were applied
- Antivirus definitions were updated

The system was monitored to confirm normal behavior and absence of recurring alerts.

## Phase 5: Post-Incident Analysis

### Root Cause Analysis

The incident was attributed to suspicious PowerShell execution enabled by insufficient execution restrictions and lack of enhanced script logging.

---

### Lessons Learned and Recommendations

- Enable PowerShell script block logging
- Restrict PowerShell execution policies
- Improve endpoint monitoring and alerting
- Reinforce user security awareness

---

## Key Takeaways

- Structured incident response reduces risk and impact
- Early containment is critical to limiting damage
- Documentation is a core responsibility in SecOps
- Following a defined IR lifecycle improves consistency and accountability

---

## Disclaimer

This assessment was conducted strictly in a controlled lab environment using a simulated security incident. No production systems or real-world targets were involved.
