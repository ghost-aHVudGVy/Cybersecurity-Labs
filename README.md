# Cybersecurity-Labs
A collection of hands-on cybersecurity labs documenting practical experience in ethical hacking, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and post-exploitation.
Each lab is fully documented and includes tools used, step-by-step methodology, screenshots, key findings, and personal takeaways.

## ğŸ“Œ Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:

- Develop and refine practical cybersecurity skills
- Document my learning journey
- Showcase my capabilities to future employers, collaborators, and the security community

## ğŸ§  What You'll Find in Each Lab
Each lab folder contains:

- `README.md`: Walkthrough of the lab with objectives, methodology, tools, findings, and what I learned.
- `screenshots/`: Visual evidence of key stages and successful exploitation.
- `scripts/` *(if applicable)*: Custom or adapted scripts used during the lab.
- `notes.txt`: Personal notes, references, or follow-up ideas.

This repository is a **living project** â€” more labs are added weekly as I continue exploring new tools, vulnerabilities, and techniques.

Stay tuned!
