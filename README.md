# Cybersecurity Labs  
**Hands-on Blue Team & Ethical Hacking Practice**

---

## About This Repository  
This repository documents my hands-on cybersecurity labs, where I explore both **offensive and defensive security concepts** through real-world simulations.

Each lab includes practical exercises in **ethical hacking, vulnerability assessment, threat detection, and incident response**, complete with screenshots, methodologies, and personal takeaways.

The purpose of this project is to:
- Strengthen my technical and analytical cybersecurity skills  
- Document my learning journey in a professional, structured way  
- Share my progress with potential employers and the security community
