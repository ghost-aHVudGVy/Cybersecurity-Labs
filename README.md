# Cybersecurity Portfolio

## About Me

I am an early-career cybersecurity practitioner focused on building strong fundamentals across application security, vulnerability management, cloud security, and incident response.

This repository represents my commitment to hands-on learning, clear documentation, and ethical security practices.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of hands-on cybersecurity labs conducted in controlled environments as part of my practical training and skills development.

The goal of these labs is to demonstrate real-world security fundamentals across offensive and defensive domains, including reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, application security, cloud security, incident response, and secure development practices.

All activities were performed ethically in isolated lab environments, personal virtual machines, or authorized public test targets, with a strong emphasis on documentation, risk awareness, and defensive takeaways.

A controlled phishing simulation using a cloned website to demonstrate how credential harvesting attacks work and how defenders can detect and mitigate them.

Focus areas:
- Social engineering attack mechanics
- Credential capture artifacts
- Detection indicators
- Defensive controls such as MFA and user awareness

---

### Network Reconnaissance with Nmap
Host discovery and service enumeration against an authorized public test target.

Focus areas:
- TCP scanning and service detection
- OS and version fingerprinting
- Interpreting scan results
- Defensive visibility and mitigation strategies

---

### WHOIS & Subdomain Reconnaissance (Recon-ng)
Passive OSINT reconnaissance using public data sources to map a domain’s external footprint.

Focus areas:
- WHOIS metadata analysis
- Subdomain discovery
- Asset visibility and exposure
- Defensive monitoring recommendations

---

### Vulnerability Assessment & Risk Prioritization (Nessus)
A professional-style vulnerability assessment against Windows and Linux systems using Nessus Essentials.

Focus areas:

- CVSS interpretation and limitations
- False positive validation
- Risk-based vulnerability prioritization
- Remediation and verification planning

---

### Web Application Security Assessment (OWASP Juice Shop)
Manual web application security testing against a deliberately vulnerable application.

Focus areas:
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- SQL injection and XSS validation
- HTTP request analysis with Burp Suite

---

### Incident Response Lifecycle Simulation
A simulated endpoint security incident following the NIST SP 800-61 incident response lifecycle.

Focus areas:
- Detection and triage
- Containment and eradication
- Recovery actions
- Post-incident analysis and lessons learned

---

### AWS Cloud Security Fundamentals
An entry-level cloud security implementation in AWS Free Tier.

Focus areas:
- Shared responsibility model
- IAM users, roles, policies, and MFA

- Common cloud misconfigurations

---

### Threat Modeling & Risk Assessment
A consulting-style threat modeling exercise using the STRIDE methodology.

Focus areas:
- Asset identification
- Threat and attack path analysis
- Likelihood and impact assessment
- Business risk explanation
- Practical mitigations

---

### Secure Software Development Lifecycle (Secure SDLC)
Integration of security into each phase of the SDLC for a small web application.

Focus areas:
- Security requirements and design review
- Secure coding practices
- Security testing in CI/CD
- Developer collaboration and communication
- DevSecOps mindset
