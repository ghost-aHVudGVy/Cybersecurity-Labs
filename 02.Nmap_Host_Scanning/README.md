# Nmap Host Scanning Lab

## Description:  
In this lab, I used Nmap to scan a remote host and learn how to identify open ports, running services, and operating system details.

---

## Objective

- Understand how to run basic and advanced Nmap scans
- Learn how to interpret scan results
- Identify ports, services, and OS information from a target host

---

## Environment & Tools Used

- **Operating System:** Kali Linux (running in a virtual machine)
- **Tool:** Nmap (pre-installed in Kali)
- **Target Host:** scanme.nmap.org (safe practice site provided by Nmap)

---

## Steps Taken / Summary of Execution

### ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Basic Scan
- Opened the terminal in Kali and ran:
  ```bash
  nmap scanme.nmap.org
This scanned the top 1000 ports and showed 4 open ports with basic service info.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Advanced Scan with Root Access
Tried running:
    ```bash
    sudo nmap -v -sT -sV -O scanme.nmap.org

***This scan revealed:*** 
1. **Open Ports (TCP):**
    - **22 (SSH)**Â â€“ Blocked/restricted (**`tcpwrapped`**).
    - **80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 8080 (HTTP-alt)**Â â€“ Web services running.
2. **Closed/Filtered Ports:**
    - **53 (DNS)**Â â€“ Closed.
    - **995 others**Â â€“ Filtered (likely firewalled).
3. **OS Detection:**
    - LikelyÂ **VirtualBox/QEMU**Â (virtual machine).
    - No exact OS match (limited scan conditions).
4. **Key Insight:**
    - **No service versions**Â detected (**`tcpwrapped`**Â suggests restricted access).

### ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Exploring Other Scan Flags
Tried other scan options like: `sudo nmap -A scanme.nmap.org`

***This scan revealed more details:*** 
1. **Open Ports & Services**:
    - **22/tcp (SSH)**
        - Exposed SSH host keys (DSA, RSA, ECDSA, ED25519).
        - Indicates SSH is running but may be firewrapped (**`tcpwrapped`**).
    - **80/tcp (HTTP)**
        - **Web server**: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu).
        - **Title**:Â *"Go ahead and ScanMe!"*Â (confirms itâ€™s Nmapâ€™s test server).
        - **Favicon**: Nmap Project logo.
    - **443/tcp (HTTPS)**Â &Â **8080/tcp (HTTP-alt)**
        - Open but no additional details (likely similar to port 80).
2. **Closed/Filtered**:
    - **53/tcp (DNS)**Â â†’ Closed (no DNS service on TCP).
    - **995 other ports**Â â†’ Filtered (no response, likely firewalled).
3. **OS & Network**:
    - **Likely OS**: Virtualized (Oracle VirtualBox/QEMU).
    - **Network Distance**: 1 hop (youâ€™re close to the server, possibly same ISP).
4. **Traceroute**:
    - Direct connection (no intermediate hops).

## **Whatâ€™s New vs. Previous Scan?**

- **SSH Host Keys**Â (useful for fingerprinting).
- **HTTP Details**Â (server version, page title, favicon).
- **Traceroute Confirmation**Â (no middlemen).

## **Bottom Line:**

This scan reveals:

- AÂ **Ubuntu Apache server**Â running on port 80 with a test page.
- **SSH is available**Â (but may be restricted).
- The host is likely aÂ **virtual machine**Â (VirtualBox/QEMU).

## Key Learnings / Observations
- Nmap is an essential tool for network reconnaissance.
- Even a simple scan reveals useful information like open ports and services.
- Advanced scans require root access but give deeper insights, including service versions and OS guesses.
- The ***-A*** flag combines multiple scan techniques and gives a more detailed picture of the target.

## Screenshots
Screenshots are saved in the screenshots/ folder:

- [aggressive_scan.png](./Screenshots/02.aggressive_scan.png)

## Challenges Faced / Troubleshooting
- Root Access Needed: Couldnâ€™t perform advanced scans without sudo. Fixed by rerunning the command with sudo.
- Firewall Consideration: Some scan results may vary if a firewall is present. In this case, the target was intentionally left open for scanning.

## Conclusion
This lab gave me hands-on experience using Nmap for both basic and advanced host scanning. I learned how to extract useful information about a target system. It also helped me better understand how attackers gather intelligence, which is key for defending systems effectively.
