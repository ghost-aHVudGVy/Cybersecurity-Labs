# Vulnerability Assessment & Risk Prioritization
### Nessus Essentials – Vulnerability Management Lab

---

## Overview

This project documents a professional-style vulnerability assessment conducted in a controlled home lab environment using **Nessus Essentials**.

The objective of the assessment was to identify, analyze, and prioritize vulnerabilities across both Windows and Linux systems using **authenticated and unauthenticated scans**, while applying **risk-based prioritization** rather than relying solely on CVSS scores.

This lab mirrors real-world vulnerability management and consulting engagements.

---

## Scope of Assessment

### In-Scope Assets
- One Windows system
- One Linux system

### Out of Scope
- Production systems
- External networks
- Real-world client environments

---

## Tooling Used

- Nessus Essentials
- Windows 11 (Target)
- Linux (Fedora) (Target)

---

## Methodology

The assessment followed a structured vulnerability management approach:

1. Asset identification
2. Unauthenticated vulnerability scanning
3. Authenticated vulnerability scanning
4. Validation of findings
5. Risk-based prioritization
6. Remediation recommendations
7. Verification planning

---

## Environment Setup

### Scanner
- Nessus Essentials installed on a dedicated scanning VM
- Plugins fully updated prior to scanning

**Evidence**
- Nessus dashboard and plugin update status

---

### Targets

- Windows system configured with local administrator credentials for authenticated scanning
- Linux system configured with SSH access and sudo permissions

**Evidence**
- Windows system reachable from scanner

- Linux system reachable from scanner

## Scan Types Performed

---

## Unauthenticated Scan

### Purpose
- Identify externally visible vulnerabilities
- Simulate an attacker without credentials

### Actions Performed
- Configured a Basic Network Scan
- No credentials supplied
- Targeted both Windows and Linux systems

**Evidence**
- Unauthenticated scan configuration

- Unauthenticated scan results overview

### Key Observation
Unauthenticated scans provided a surface-level view and missed many internal configuration and patch-related issues.

---

## Authenticated Scan

### Purpose
- Identify internal vulnerabilities
- Simulate insider threat or malware with credentials

### Credentials Used
- Windows: Local administrator account
- Linux: SSH user with elevated privileges

### Actions Performed
- Configured Windows and SSH credentials in Nessus
- Re-ran scans against both systems

**Evidence**
- Authenticated scan credential configuration

- Authenticated scan results overview

### Key Observation
Authenticated scans produced significantly more detailed and actionable findings than unauthenticated scans.

## CVSS Scoring Analysis

### Understanding CVSS

CVSS scores were reviewed to understand technical severity based on exploitability and impact.

**Evidence**
- Example vulnerability with CVSS scoring details

### Limitations of CVSS

CVSS scores were not treated as the sole indicator of risk. Additional factors were considered:
- System exposure
- Exploit availability
- Asset criticality
- Business impact

---

## False Positive Validation

### Validation Approach
- Reviewed Nessus plugin output in detail
- Verified service status and software versions directly on target systems
- Confirmed whether vulnerabilities were exploitable in context

**Evidence**
- Plugin output reviewed for validation

### Key Takeaway
Automated tools assist detection, but manual validation is required to ensure accuracy and credibility.

---

## Risk-Based Vulnerability Prioritization

Vulnerabilities were prioritized based on:
- Internet exposure
- Likelihood of exploitation
- Availability of public exploits
- Potential business impact
- Ability to chain vulnerabilities

**Evidence**
- Prioritized vulnerability list in Nessus

### Example Prioritization Logic
- Medium CVSS vulnerability on exposed RDP service prioritized higher
- High CVSS vulnerability on unused local service deprioritized

---

## Common Findings Observed

### Windows System
- Missing critical security patches
- SMB configuration weaknesses
- Outdated services

**Evidence**
- Windows vulnerability details  
  screenshots/11_windows_vulnerability_details.png

---

### Linux System
- Outdated packages
- Kernel-related vulnerabilities
- SSH configuration findings

**Evidence**
- Linux vulnerability details

## Remediation Recommendations

For each high-priority vulnerability, the following were provided:
- Clear remediation actions
- Patch or configuration guidance
- Verification steps using re-scanning

**Evidence**
- Example remediation guidance from Nessus

---

## Verification & Re-Scanning

Where applicable, remediation actions were followed by re-scanning to validate successful mitigation of vulnerabilities.

**Evidence**
- Re-scan showing reduced findings

---

## Key Takeaways

- Authenticated scanning is essential for accurate vulnerability assessment
- CVSS scores must be interpreted in context
- False positives must be validated manually
- Risk-based prioritization is critical for effective vulnerability management
- Clear remediation guidance adds real value to assessments

## Disclaimer

This vulnerability assessment was conducted strictly in a controlled lab environment for educational and portfolio purposes. No production systems or real-world targets were tested.
